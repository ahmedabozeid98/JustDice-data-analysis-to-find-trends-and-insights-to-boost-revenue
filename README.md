# JustDice-data-analysis-to-find-trends-and-insights-to-boost-revenue
In this project, we aim to analyze the data from JustDice, a mobile gaming company, using Python and machine learning clustering methods to identify trends and insights that can help boost revenue.

First, we will collect and preprocess the data .

Next, we will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data and identify any patterns or correlations between the various features. We will also perform feature engineering to create new features that may be useful in predicting user behavior and revenue.

After preprocessing and EDA, we will apply machine learning clustering methods to group users based on their behavior . We will also use dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to visualize the clusters and identify any interesting patterns.

Using the clusters, we will identify the characteristics of high-value users, such as those who make frequent in-app purchases or any useful findings

Overall, this project will provide valuable insights into user behavior for JustDice and help them develop effective strategies for boosting revenue, improving user retention, and enhancing user engagement.
